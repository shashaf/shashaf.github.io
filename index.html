				<span class="default-text">oh hi there... I mean, hello! Hello and good...</span><br>
				<span id = "greetings" class="default-text">Good... uuuhhmmmmm... </span><br>
				<span class="default-text">I'm glad to see you on the web page dedicated to the development of my own game! Her draft title is UNDERLEGENDS: Justice and Patience. This is a fan game set in the Undertale universe - another great game that I love so much! On this page you can find out some information about my project.</span>			
				<br><h3>About me and the game</h3><br>
				<span class="default-text">One summer, when I was a 17-year-old going to the country and thinking about my favorite game, Undertale, I thought, "God, there are so many untold stories in this universe! It would be cool if they were told in other games. What they can be?" And after a few hours I came up with a complete story for one of these games.</span>
				<br><span class="default-text">Since then, 3 years have passed and all these 3 years I have been haunted by the thought that I really really want to tell the story that I came up with. But I didn't know how to make games, so I decided to start with what I can - I made music for it. I enjoyed doing it so much that in 2020 I decided to study as a programmer in order to learn how to make games and finish my dream project. But in order to finish it, I have to start it, and at this point I found myself in the summer of 2022.</span>
				<br><span class="default-text">I started learning the GameMaker Studio 2 engine. I decided to try to implement on my own all the mechanics that are in the original game. Once I've done that, all I have to do is put all the design and story that I came up with on this rod.</span>
				<br><span class= "default-text">In parallel with this, I reworked and finalized the soundtrack, rewrote the plot several times. As a result, the game has grown to such a scale that it can be released in 3 chapters. Chapter 1 will be a demo version and something is already ready for it, albeit quite a bit. Why not take a look at it together?</span>
				<br><h3>Mini Preview ?!</h3>

				<p class = "default-text">Everyone knows that the most important thing in games is to be able to approach the tablets and read the inscriptions on them!</p>
				<img src = "video/tablet.gif" id = "tabletgif" class="animation"></img><br>
				<p class = "default-text">Sorry... The combat system is not ready yet, I only have the start animation and the combat menu, but there are no enemies yet and you have no one to fight with. Actually, I would leave it like this because violence is terrible, but if I do that, you won't be playing my game :(</p>

				<h4>F.A.Q.</h4>
				<p class="question">Q: Will sans appear in your game?</p>
				<p class="answer">A: nah, he's too lazy to join the party.</p>

				<audio id="megalo" src="music/mglvn.mp3"></audio>
				<p class="question">Q: And what about other familiar characters?</p>
				<p class="answer">A: I try to focus on the original story and characters, but there might be someone you'll be happy to see!</p>
				<p class="question">Q: Can I pet a dog in your game???</p>
				<p class="answer">A: I'm afraid the answer is no, but you can do it right here! (click on the doge several times)</p>

			<h3>Development progress</h3>
			<span class="default-text">Well, since this is a status update, I should say how ready the game is now. At least how it feels to me.</span><br>
			<span class="bold-text" id="progress">Story: 75%<br>Music: 90%<br>Design: 0.01% (help me pls)<br>Gameplay: like 30%</span>
			<br><span class="default-text">As you can see, I am a musician first and foremost. A musician who is very bad at design. Therefore, I simultaneously offer you the services of composing and ask you for help with drawing! If you are interested, please contact me:</span>

			<h3>Conclusion</h3>
			<span class="default-text">Well, that's all I wanted to show for now. Hope you had fun. I have to implement a countdown script, so I'll put a possible release date here, but don't take it too seriously. I have no idea how long this will take.</span>
